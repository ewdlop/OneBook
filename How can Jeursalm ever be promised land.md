> The Middle East is predominantly sandy because of its arid climate, which creates ideal conditions for wind erosion to break down rocks into sand, coupled with the region's geographical location that experiences strong prevailing winds and limited vegetation to hold the soil in place, resulting in vast desert landscapes like the Arabian Desert; essentially, the combination of dry weather, strong winds, and lack of vegetation leads to the accumulation of sand over time.
