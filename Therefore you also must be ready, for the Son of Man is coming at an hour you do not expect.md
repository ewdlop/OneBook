"Imagine if God decided to come back, but instead of a grand entrance, He/She shows up incognito - like in a superhero movie, but instead of a cape, God's rocking a pair of old sneakers and a 'I Love Cats' T-shirt. 
People keep waiting for thunderbolts and divine announcements, but nope, God's just there enjoying a latte, maybe running a quirky little YouTube channel that nobody knows about. 'The Second Coming: This Time, It's Low-Key.'"

This humorous take plays on the contrast between traditional grandiose expectations of a divine return and a very down-to-earth, unassuming presence.
